    "# Extra credit. A very basic cosmological analysis with SNe Ia\n",
    "One of the big drivers of Rubin Observatory is to understand the nature of dark energy, which we believe is a field that pushes things apart. Type Ia supernovae are a great way to do this - we know very well how they evolve, because it's remarkably constant throughout the Universe. This is actually still a mystery - models for their explosion suggest that the explosions should be more different than they are. Anyway, the fact that they're predictable is great for us, because when one explodes we can calculate how far away it is from how dim it is relative to our expectations. Type Ia supernovae confirmed that the universe's expansion was accelerating in the 90's, which led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics."
